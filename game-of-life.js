// This Kata is about calculating the next generation of Conwayâ€™s game of life,
// given any starting position

// 1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by underpopulation.
// 2. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
// 3. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
// 4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell.
